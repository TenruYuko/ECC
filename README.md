# ECC, Ethical Code of Conduct
# Recognition of human dignity and worth.
1.) Always recognize that each and every single person has their worth as a human being, regardless of their actions, opinions, political stance or religious beliefs.

1.a) Even if that worth is **low**.

2.b) Every "Human" is a "Person".



2.) Respect that each action a person makes is their own, and despite the fact it may influence you or affect you, it was, in the end, still their decision.

2.a) This does not stand for blackmail. Blackmail switches the moral conduct's initiator's action to the person black mailing.

2.b) Always remember that behind every action, has **intention**. Never underestimate that intention.


3.) Treat all forms of religion as they are; a piece of hope or salvation for an individual to guide them through both the dark as well as the light, and is to be treated as a blessing rather than a curse. 

3.a) Unless you are at the end of your life, not once am I to convince somebody of their religion being false or anything of the sort

3.a.1) This does **not** stand for cults/cultists.


4.)  Do not judge a person merely by opinion, political stance, temporary mindset, or any identifying outside factors, such as race, age, or any others. People are complicated creatures, and the beliefs they may hold may be for an unknown reason, even if it doesn't seem like such. Upon that point, stands no shame to be any kind of race; simply put, no discrimination by labels.
