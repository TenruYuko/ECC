# ECC, Ethical Code of Conduct
# Recignition of human dignity and worth.
1.) Always recognize that each and every single person has their worth as a human being, regardless of their actions, opinions, political stance or religious beliefs.
1.a) Even if that worth is **low**.
2.b) Every "Human" is a "Person".

2.) Respect that each action a person makes is their own, and despite the fact it may influence you or affect you, it was, in the end, still their decision.
2.a) This does not stand for blackmail. Blackmail switches the moral conduct's initiator's action to the person black mailing.
